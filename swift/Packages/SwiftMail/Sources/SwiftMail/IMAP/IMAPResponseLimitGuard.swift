/// Enforces ``IMAPParserLimits/bodySizeLimit`` across a whole FETCH response, and makes every
/// parser-limit violation fail closed.
///
/// ## Why this exists at the pipeline level
/// `ResponseParser` applies `bodySizeLimit` to **each streaming body section on its own** and
/// keeps no response-wide total. SwiftMail's own consumers, meanwhile, accumulate: both
/// `FetchPartHandler` and `PipelinedFetchPartHandler` append every streaming attribute into a
/// single `Data` until the FETCH finishes. So with `bodySizeLimit: 64 MiB` a server could return
/// any number of 50 MiB sections in one FETCH — each one passing the check, all of them landing
/// in one buffer. The documented memory guard was bypassable.
///
/// The total could be counted in those two handlers, but then it would hold only for the two
/// that exist today, and only for as long as nobody adds a third. The limit is a **transport**
/// promise — `IMAPServer` documents it as server-level policy — so it is enforced on the
/// transport, once, for every consumer including future ones.
///
/// ## Why it also closes the connection
/// Because a limit that is reported but not acted on is not a limit. Parser-limit errors
/// previously did not fail closed: during IDLE, `IdleHandler.errorCaught` only failed a private
/// promise that nothing was awaiting until a later DONE, while the decoder kept the rejected
/// bytes and appended every subsequent read to them before raising the same error again — the
/// post-decode buffer cap is skipped when decoding throws. A peer could keep growing memory
/// while the caller's `AsyncStream` sat there waiting. The guard therefore closes the channel on
/// any limit violation: the connection has already proven it is hostile or broken, and the one
/// thing that must not happen is to keep reading from it.
