/**
 An actor that represents a connection to an IMAP server.

 Use this class to establish and manage connections to IMAP servers, perform authentication,
 and execute IMAP commands. The class handles connection lifecycle, command execution,
 and maintains server state.

 Example:
 ```swift
 let server = IMAPServer(host: "imap.example.com", port: 993)
 try await server.connect()
 try await server.login(username: "user@example.com", password: "password")
 ```

 - Note: All operations are logged using the Swift Logging package. To view logs in Console.app:
 1. Open Console.app
 2. Search for "process:com.cocoanetics.SwiftMail"
 3. Adjust the "Action" menu to show Debug and Info messages

    /**
     Initialize a new IMAP server connection

     - Parameters:
     - host: The hostname of the IMAP server
     - port: The port number of the IMAP server (typically 993 for SSL)
     - transportSecurity: The transport security policy to use. `.automatic` infers from standard IMAP
     ports; explicit values override that inference.
     - certificateVerificationPolicy: The certificate verification policy to use for TLS connections.
     - minimumTLSVersion: The lowest TLS version any transport may negotiate. Defaults to
     ``MailTLSMinimumVersion/tlsv12``, the lowest version RFC 8996 still permits. Pass
     ``MailTLSMinimumVersion/tlsv13`` when every server you talk to supports it, which makes
     a downgrade impossible regardless of what the server offers.
     - numberOfThreads: The number of threads to use for the event loop group
     - parserLimits: Bounds the response parser enforces against a hostile or malfunctioning
     server. Defaults to ``IMAPParserLimits/default``, which leaves body size and attribute
     count unbounded — the behaviour before this parameter existed.
     - responseBufferLimit: Maximum bytes the IMAP response parser may buffer
     before failing with `PayloadTooLargeError`. Defaults to
     ``IMAPServer/defaultResponseBufferLimit`` (1 MB), which handles large SEARCH
     responses containing thousands of message IDs. Raise it for very dense
     mailboxes whose SEARCH/FETCH responses exceed 1 MB. Must be greater than 0.

     - Precondition: `responseBufferLimit > 0` — a non-positive limit would make
     every response exceed the buffer and fail with `PayloadTooLargeError`.
