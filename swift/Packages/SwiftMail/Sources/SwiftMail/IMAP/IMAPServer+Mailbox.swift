     Get status information about a mailbox without selecting it

     This method uses the IMAP STATUS command to retrieve standard attributes of a mailbox

     RECENT, UNSEEN) and optional attributes based on server capabilities.

     - Parameter mailboxName: The name of the mailbox to get status for

     - Important: Many servers emit a warning (e.g. `OK [CLIENTBUG] Status on selected mailbox`) when
     `STATUS` is issued for the currently selected mailbox. Call this method when no mailbox is selected
     (before `selectMailbox(_)`) or after `unselectMailbox()`/`closeMailbox()` to avoid the warning.
